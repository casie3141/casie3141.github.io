My name is Casie Lin, and I am a Statistics B.S. and Economics B.A. double major at the University of Florida. I am a rising junior and expect to graduate in Fall 2025 or Spring 2026. Previously, I was a Public Health major and have always been interested in the realms of public policy, epidemiology, and biostatistics. Alongside my Statistics coursework, I have taken most prerequisite health coursework, including all of general Chemistry and Biology, Organic Chemistry 1, Psychology, and Anatomy and Physiology. I hope to combine my expertise in data with my passion for biological topics to gain a better understanding of health issues in the world today.
